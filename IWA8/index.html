  What I was required to do

Unfortunately at the moment, when running the code snippet we get the following error: Uncaught SyntaxError:
 Missing initializer in const declaration

Note that the new objects should have a nested address object that contains all address-specific information, i.e. street name, house number and postal code.
* Also, note that all values in the object should be reassigned from the variables at the top of the file.
* The only exception is the new age value that is added to the object.
* In the latter, we assign a value directly when declaring the object.
